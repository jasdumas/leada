##Visualizing Crime Data
###Introduction
You've just been hired by the city of San Francisco to use analytics to combat its crime issues.
The first task they want to do is to better understand the crime patterns throughout the city.
You're tasked with creating visualization(s) that will help the city better interpret the crime data that gets updated daily.
You're aren't given restrictions on plot type and you must come up with your own analysis.
###Data Source
The crime data can be downloaded below:
https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/SFPD-Incidents-Previous-Three-Months/tmnf-yvry?
The data contains many features including district, category, and crime types.
###Project Goals
As mentioned before, the type of visualization is entirely up to you.
You might want to consider creating plots that encompass the following:
- Where shouldn't you park your car?
- What are the safest locations in SF? What days/times are especially dangerous?
- Are certain thefts more common in certain areas?
##Documentation Instructions
Make sure to explain in the summary of your findings how your visualization(s) supports your insights.
You are free to complete the project in any language/framework you like.
Be sure to explain the framework and any external packages with proper documentation.
Remember, having a maintainable & legible codebase leads to good karma :)
